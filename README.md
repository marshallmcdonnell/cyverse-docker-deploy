# cyverse-docker-deploy
Deploy a minimal version of CyVerse using Docker

This originally started as a fork from [CyVerse's irods-docker-deploy](https://github.com/cyverse/irods-docker-deploy)
to setup the data store.

This is extended to include the [CyVerse Discover Environment](https://github.com/cyverse-de)
